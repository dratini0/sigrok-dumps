uart_analog_10700_8n2.sr:

This was captured from an ATMega328p running at 1Mz from the internal oscillator, with a DDR0 of 5.
The device used to capture this was a Hantek 6022BE, with an 8MHz sample rate, single channel.
I programmed the ATMega to output bytes between 0x1A and 0x20, separated by null bytes.
I used a single start bit, no parity and two stop bits.
